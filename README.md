Getting started
======

* Datomic
  * Setup datomic by following https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/dev-setup.html - e.g. these examples used
 the "pro" version from https://my.datomic.com/downloads/pro with an on-prem developer license.
  * run `bin/maven-install` to give yourself maven access to the above as it doesn't seem to be installed into any
public maven repos (at the time of writing) 
* Follow instructions to load the mbrainz data at https://github.com/Datomic/mbrainz-sample
